# **Thumbnail-creator**

<mark>**‚ö†Ô∏è** The command will reduce the quality of the image but this won't be a problem due to the thumbnails are small and don't require to much quality</mark>

The command will make a search throught the current directory to find all the images or the image in the following formats:
- jpg
- png
- jpeg

The images will be transformed into thumbnails with the exact size and background-color for odoo's snippets  ( the original image isn't modified the command creates a copy )
